# Ocean Data Farming Script

For each did that matches the chainId:

          1. get pools for that did

          2. get snapshots of shares from startBlock to endBlock, from chunk to chunk

          3. compute average share  (sum all shares from step 2 and dividem them by nr of snapshots)

          4. get consume count

          5. compute reward

          6. add reward for did to global rewards

Write rewards to csv

## Valid DIDS
For now, the script loads a json file (dids.json).  Once the repo is going to be public, we are going to load dids from https://github.com/oceanprotocol/datafarming/blob/main/datafarms-list.json


## Install deps
```bash
npm i
```

## Run the script
```bash
node ./index.js https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/XXX 10912100 12912700 1000000
```
This will calculate rewards for mainnet, from block 10912100 to block 12912700, using shares snapshots every 1000000 blocks
Rewards are written to a file (check output)
