# Ocean Data Farming Script

For each did that matches the chainId:

          1. get pools for that did

          2. get snapshots of shares from startBlock to endBlock, from chunk to chunk

          3. compute average share  (sum all shares from step 2 and dividem them by nr of snapshots)

          4. get consume count

          5. compute reward

          6. add reward for did to global rewards

Write rewards to csv

## Install deps
```bash
npm i
```

## dids.json
  This contains the list of accepted dids and their chain.id
  Example:
  ```json
  [
    {
        "did": "did:op:a2B8b3aC4207CFCCbDe4Ac7fa40214fd00A2BA71",
        "chainId": 1
    },
    {
        "did": "did:op:7Bce67697eD2858d0683c631DdE7Af823b7eea38",
        "chainId": 1
    },
    {
        "did": "did:op:b07a8bb80242752ce164560ABCb6517DA90a4F65",
        "chainId": 1
    },
    {
        "did": "did:op:326e6BbFc725b63A7BC3c7C052C48d10d9D3BFCf",
        "chainId": 137
    },
    {
        "did": "did:op:3af10546654FCe4b42D948aB485D13D9EFB427D7",
        "chainId": 137
    },
    {
        "did": "did:op:2a82D20D65565Be093576Ed9000c4b853D005be3",
        "chainId": 56
    }
]
```

## Config.json
   This contains the config parameters, for each network:
   ```json
   [
    {
        "subgraphURL":"https://subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph",
        "chainId":1,
        "startBlockNo":10100645,
        "endBlockNo":13100645,
        "rpc":"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/XXXXX",
        "chunkSize": 100000
    },
    {
        "subgraphURL":"https://subgraph.bsc.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph",
        "chainId":56,
        "startBlockNo":10004272,
        "endBlockNo":10364272,
        "rpc":"https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/",
        "chunkSize": 100000
    },
    {
        "subgraphURL":"https://subgraph.polygon.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph",
        "chainId":137,
        "startBlockNo":13413668,
        "endBlockNo":18413668,
        "rpc":"https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/XXXX",
        "chunkSize": 100000
    }
]
   ```
      

## Run the script
```bash
node ./index.js dids.json config.json 
```
This will calculate rewards for mainnet, from block 10912100 to block 12912700, using shares snapshots every 1000000 blocks
Rewards are written to a file (check output)
